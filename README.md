# Labyrinth

This is an application that can be flashed and played on the BBC micro:bit microcomputer. It utilizes the accelerometer and LEDs to indicate your location in the maze. The blinking light is your current location. Tilt the micro:bit up, down, left, or right and the dot will attempt to move in that direction.
The walls of the maze are invisible. If the direction you have chosen is blocked by an invisible wall, the dot cannot move in that direction. You will have to find a way around it!

Navigate the blinking light to the solid light to win the game!

Note: The game is still in progress. Currently only the accelerometer based movement and LED updating is implemented. The maze portion is being worked on next.
